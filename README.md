## Local Development Setup

SlugLink is fully on your computer and requires each dependency (for example Turso ClI) to be installed in order to start the local development.

### 0. Prerequisites

- [Turso](https://turso.tech/)
- Follow the instructions in the [Turso setup guide](TURSO_GUIDE.md) to set up your Turso database.
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)
- Follow the instructions in the [Github setup guide](GITHUB_SETUP.md) to set up your Google Cloud project.

### 1. Fork and clone the repository

Follow [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) to create a fork of this repository and then clone it to your local machine.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<github user>/SlugLink.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the repo directory

After cloning move into the cloned repo:

```shell
cd slug-link
```

### 3. Install dependencies

#### Installing `node`:

If you have node already installed in your computer you can avoid this step. To install `node` [download the installer](https://nodejs.org/en/) from their site. Please download the lates and [LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en).

#### Installing `pnpm`:

`pnpm` is a package manager that is used to install all dependencies needed.

If you would like to read more about `pnpm` you can visit [their documentation](https://pnpm.io/motivation).

The best way to install `pnpm` for this project is by using [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html), a new feature bundled with Node.

Install pnpm with the following commands (there are more ways to install 'pnpm' if you prefer to use a different method please visit [pnpm's installation page](https://pnpm.io/installation)):

```sh
npm install -g pnpm
```

#### Setting up your .env

Use the following command to create a local `.env` file. Then open the new file (`.env`) to make any changes required in the document.

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Installing package dependencies

Once you have `node`, `pnpm` installed, please run the following command to install all dependencies:

```shell
pnpm install
```

After running the command above, you should see a `node_modules` folder in your project root. This is where all the dependencies are installed. At this point you can run the project locally using the following command:

#### Turso and Prisma before running the environment

- Follow the [Prisma and Turso guide](PRISMA_TURSO_GUIDE.md) to migrate and create the tables into your created Turso data base. to set up your Turso database.

#### Run the environment

```shell
pnpm dev
```

Once you run this command, a local server is running at http://localhost:3000 any changes that you make to the code will be reflected on the browser automatically.
