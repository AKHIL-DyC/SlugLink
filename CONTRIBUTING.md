## Issues & Pull Requests

### Creating an Issue

Before **creating** an Issue for `features`/`bugs`/`improvements` please follow these steps:

1. search existing Issues before creating a new issue (has someone raised this already)
1. if it doesn't exist create a new issue giving as much context as possible (please select the correct Issue type, for example `bug` or `feature`)

### Working on an Issue (get it assigned to you)

Before working on an existing Issue please follow these steps:

1. only ask to be assigned 1 **open** issue at a time.
1. comment asking for the issue to be assigned to you.
1. after the Issue is assigned to you, you can start working on it.
1. **only** start working on this Issue (and open a Pull Request) when it has been assigned to you - this will prevent confusion, multiple people working on the same issue and work not being used.
1. reference the Issue in your Pull Request (for example `closes #123`). This will automatically close the Issue when the Pull Request is merged.

> Notes:
>
> - check the `Assignees` box at the top of the page to see if the issue has been assigned to someone else before requesting this be assigned to you
> - if an Issue is unclear, ask questions to get more clarity before asking to have the Issue assigned to you
> - only request to be assigned an Issue if you know how to work on it
> - any Issues that have no activity after 2 weeks will be unassigned and re-assigned to someone else
